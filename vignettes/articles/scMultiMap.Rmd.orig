This vignette shows two examples of applying `scMultiMap` to infer cell-type-specific peak-gene associations with single-cell multimodal data.

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(scMultiMap)
library(Signac)
library(Seurat)
# for consistency analysis 
library(GenomicRanges)
library(rtracklayer)
```

# 1. Toy example

To illustrate the basic functionality of `scMultiMap`, we use a toy Seurat object `small_obj` and a data frame of candidate peak-gene pairs `small_pairs_df` provided in the R package to run `scMultiMap`:
```{r}
# a Seurat object
small_obj

# candidate peak-gene pairs
head(small_pairs_df)
dim(small_pairs_df)
```

With these example data, we then run `scMultiMap`:
```{r}
res <- scMultiMap(small_obj, small_pairs_df) # < 0.1 seconds
head(res)
dim(res)
```

Here, scMultiMap takes a Seurat object with two modalities: RNA and peak, and evaluates the associations between 250 peak-gene pairs. We assume that this Seurat object contains the cells from a specific cell type of interest, such that the inferred associations are cell-type-specific.

# 2. PBMC example, 10x Multiome data

## 2.1 Note: fragment counts are required for scMultiMap

Before demonstrating `scMultiMap` on real data, we highlight an important requirement for peak counts. As discussed in "Discussion" in scMultiMap's [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614814v1), scMultiMap is designed to model **fragment counts**, which are more suitable for count-based modeling and improve downstream analysis performance compared to insertion counts or read counts ([Miao and Kim, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02103-7), [Martens et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02112-6)). Therefore, if you plan to use `scMultiMap`, ensure the your scATAC-seq data consist of fragment counts instead of read counts. We recommend using MACS2 for peak calling, as it generates fragment counts (see [Calling peaks](https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/peak_calling)). If you only have read counts and do not have access to the ATAC-seq fragment files, fragment counts can be estimated following the approach in [Martens et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-02112-6).

To demonstrate this, we downloaded a 10x Multiome dataset (paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) from 10x, used MACS2 to call peaks by cell types, and generated `processed_seurat_obj_PBMC_10k.rds`. The source code for these steps can be found at  [scMultiMap reproducibility Github repo](https://github.com/ChangSuBiostats/scMultiMap_analysis/preprocessing/preprocess_10x_PBMC_data.R). Calling peak by cell type is to generate cell-type-specific peaks that better represent candidate cell-type-specific enhancers than those identified from merged cell types.

## 2.2 Demo of scMultiMap on CD14 Monocytes

```{r}
# set it to the directory where data are saved
data_dir <- '../../../data'
```
```{r eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
pbmc <- readRDS(sprintf('%s/processed_seurat_obj_PBMC_10k_nextgem.rds', data_dir))
# in this example, we focus on CD14 monocytes:
pbmc_cd14 <- subset(pbmc, predicted.id == 'CD14 Mono')
print(pbmc_cd14)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
pbmc_cd14 <- readRDS(sprintf('%s/CD14_obj_nextgem.rds', data_dir))
print(pbmc_cd14)
```


We choose to study the top 2000 highly expressed genes and top 20000 highly accessible peaks in CD14 Monocytes, and use a cis-region of width 1Mb to define candidate peak-gene pairs.


```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
pairs_df <- get_top_peak_gene_pairs(pbmc_cd14,
                                    gene_top=2000, peak_top=20000,
                                    distance = 5e+5,
                                    gene_assay = 'RNA', # name of the gene assay
                                    peak_assay = 'peaks_ct') # name of the peak assay
head(pairs_df)
dim(pairs_df)
```

Here, we generated `r nrow(pairs_df)` candidate peak-gene pairs generated based on the criterion above. Generally, the pairs to be studied could also be customized and supplied by users.

Nect, we run `scMultiMap` to assess peak-gene associations.

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
scMultiMap_res <- scMultiMap(pbmc_cd14, pairs_df,
                  gene_assay = 'RNA', # name of the gene assay
                  peak_assay = 'peaks_ct') # name of the peak assay
```

```{r}
head(scMultiMap_res)
```

* Running `scMultiMap` on this dataset took ~20-25 seconds using a single core of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6326 CPU @ 2.90GHz.
.
* `res` is a dataframe with association statistics and p-values for each of `r nrow(pairs_df)` peak-gene pairs.

## 2.3 Downstream analysis: consistency analysis

To demonstrate `scMultiMap` is powerful for identifying cell-type-specific enhancer-gene pairs,  we consider the examples presented in Figure~2b of the [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614814v1) and evaluate the consistency (overlap) between results from `scMultiMap` and that from promoter capture Hi-C (PCHiC). 

```{r message = FALSE}
# Data required for liftover form hg19 to hg38
# from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/liftOver/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz
chain = import.chain(sprintf("%s/hg19ToHg38.over.chain", data_dir))
```

First, we preprocess PCHiC data and lift it over from hg19 to hg38 to match the genome version used in the 10x Multiome data (hg38).
```{r}
# Obtain promoter capture Hi-C data from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.037.
# supplementary data "DATA_S1/PCHiC_peak_matrix_cutoff5.tsv"

PCHiC <- read.table(sprintf('%s/PCHiC_peak_matrix_cutoff5.tsv', data_dir), header = T)
# focus on CD14 monocytes as denoted by the column 'Mon'
PCHiC <- PCHiC[, c('oeChr', 'oeStart', 'oeEnd', # peak info
                  'baitName', # gene name,
                  'Mon')] # CHiCAGO scores for CD14 monocytes
colnames(PCHiC)[1:3] <- c('chr', 'start', 'end')
grange_hg19 <- GenomicRanges::makeGRangesFromDataFrame(df = PCHiC, keep.extra.columns = T)
seqlevelsStyle(grange_hg19) = "UCSC"
grange_hg38 <- rtracklayer::liftOver(grange_hg19, chain)
grange_hg38 <- unlist(grange_hg38)
genome(grange_hg38) = "hg38"

# significantly associated peak-gene pairs
# defined by CHiCAGO scores >=5 (reference: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.037)
sig_assay_gr <- grange_hg38[grange_hg38@elementMetadata[['Mon']] > 5]
sig_assay_gr$gene <- sig_assay_gr$baitName
```

### scMultiMap

We then evaluate its overlap with `scMultiMap`'s results.
```{r}
scMultiMap_overlap <- validate_with_assay(scMultiMap_res, sig_assay_gr, pvar = "padj", p_cutoff = 0.2)
```

### Signac
In comparison, we also evaluated `Signac`'s results.
```{r}
# By default, Signac uses normalized data to compute peak-gene associations
pbmc_cd14 <- NormalizeData(object = pbmc_cd14)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
##### 
##### The code below could take 3 hours to run, as
#####   (1) it consider all peaks instead of peaks with high abundance
#####   (2) constructing the sampling-based null distribution is computationally intensive
# Run Signac
signac_res <- LinkPeaks(pbmc_cd14, 'peaks_ct', 'RNA',
                        genes.use = unique(pairs_df$gene), # consider the same genes as above
                        pvalue_cutoff = 1, score_cutoff = 0) # return the results on all pairs
#   |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed=03h 17m 21s
######
```

```{r include=FALSE}
signac_res <- readRDS(sprintf('%s/CD14_obj_nextgem_signac_res.rds', data_dir))
```

```{r}
# Bug in Signac's p-value (01/2025):
# the two-sided p-values are evaluated with only one tail of the Gaussian distribution
# https://github.com/stuart-lab/signac/blob/8ecdde2/R/links.R#L481C29-L481C30
summary(Links(signac_res)$pvalue) # the maximum is smaller than 1
# manually adjust this
Links(signac_res)$pvalue <- 2*Links(signac_res)$pvalue

signac_res <- as.data.frame(Links(signac_res))
# consider the same set of peak-gene pairs as scMultiMap
scMultiMap_res$pg <- paste(scMultiMap_res$peak, scMultiMap_res$gene, sep = ':')
signac_res$pg <- paste(signac_res$peak, signac_res$gene, sep = ':')
signac_res <- signac_res[match(scMultiMap_res$pg, signac_res$pg), ]
```

```{r}
# consistent with evaluating scMultiMap's result, we use BH procedure and set the significance cutoff to be 0.2
signac_res$padj <- p.adjust(signac_res$pvalue, method = 'BH')
signac_overlap <- validate_with_assay(signac_res, sig_assay_gr, pvar = "padj", p_cutoff = 0.2)
```

### SCENT

We further evaluate SCENT, another method benchmarked in scMultiMap's [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614814v1), you could try the code below. Please note that it could extremely computationally intensive due to the use of boostrapping. Running the codes below took **17 hours, 34 minutes** using **8** cores of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6326 CPU @ 2.90GHz. The high computational costs were also demonstrated by Figure 1c in scMultiMap's [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614814v1).

```{r eval=F}
# Tutorial for running SCENT:
# https://github.com/immunogenomics/SCENT
if (!requireNamespace("SCENT", quietly = TRUE)) devtools::install_github("immunogenomics/SCENT")
library(SCENT)
```

```{r message = FALSE, eval=F}
# extract count matrices
peak_counts <- pbmc_cd14[['peaks_ct']]@counts[unique(pairs_df$peak),]
rna_counts <- pbmc_cd14[['RNA']]@counts[unique(pairs_df$gene),]
# construct metadata for cell-level covariates
mdata <- pbmc_cd14@meta.data
mdata$cell <- rownames(mdata)
mdata$log_total_counts <- log(colSums(pbmc_cd14[['RNA']]@counts))
covariates_set <- "log_total_counts"

SCENT_obj <- CreateSCENTObj(rna = rna_counts, atac = peak_counts,
                            meta.data = mdata,
                            peak.info = pairs_df,
                            covariates = covariates_set,
                            celltypes = 'predicted.id') # column name for the cell type label in `mdata`

start_time <- Sys.time()
SCENT_obj <- SCENT_algorithm(object = SCENT_obj, celltype = 'CD14 Mono',
                            ncores=8, # for parallelism
                             regr = 'poisson', bin = TRUE) # default
end_time <- Sys.time()

SCENT.result <- SCENT_obj@SCENT.result

# print elapsed time
elapsed <- difftime(end_time, start_time, units = "secs")
message(sprintf("scMultiMap elapsed time: %02d:%02d (mm:ss)\n",
              (as.integer(elapsed) %% 3600) %/% 60, # Minutes
              as.integer(elapsed) %% 60))        # Seconds

```

```{r include=F}
#saveRDS(SCENT_obj@SCENT.result, sprintf('%s/SCENT_results.rds', data_dir))
SCENT.result <- readRDS(sprintf('%s/SCENT_results.rds', data_dir))
```

```{r}
SCENT.result$padj <- p.adjust(SCENT.result$boot_basic_p, method = 'BH')
SCENT_overlap <- validate_with_assay(SCENT.result, sig_assay_gr, pvar = "padj", p_cutoff = 0.2)
```

### Summary of comparison

In this example, `scMultiMap` identified `r scMultiMap_overlap['n_overlap']` pairs overlapped with PCHiC data on CD14 monocytes, while `Signac` and `SCENT` only identified `r signac_overlap['n_overlap']` and `r SCENT_overlap['n_overlap']` pairs, respectively. Moreover, `scMultiMap` also gave the highest enrichment (odds ratio=`r sprintf('%.2f',scMultiMap_overlap['oddsratio'])`) compared to `Signac` (`r sprintf('%.2f',signac_overlap['oddsratio'])`) and `SCENT` (`r sprintf('%.2f',SCENT_overlap['oddsratio'])`). In particular, `SCENT` has a odds ratio smaller than 1, potentially due to a large number of false positive discoveries that are not consistent with PCHiC.

This is one example that demonstrates the improved performance by `scMultiMap` compared to existing methods. Please refer to scMultiMap's [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614814v1) for more examples, including additional consistency analysis with orthogonal assays, reproducibility analysis across independent single-cell multimodal datasets, and systematic evaluation of type I error and power.

Note that the numerical results (i.e., the numbers of reproduced pairs and odds ratio) presented here differ slightly from those in the paper, as the published analysis combined four single-cell Multiome PBMC datasets to increase power (see Methods in [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614814v1)). However, the overall conclusions regarding the comparison across methods remain unchanged.
